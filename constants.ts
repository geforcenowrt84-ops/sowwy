  apologyMessage: `I know I messed up, and I'm truly sorry. 
  
I never meant to hurt you or make you feel this way. You mean everything to me, and seeing you upset breaks my heart.

I miss your smile, your laugh, and you make everything better just for me. I promise to do better and to be more thoughtful.

Please forgive me. I love you more than words can express. ❤️`,
